# A Security Device
## Python

### Part 1
This first block of code is a security. It inputs an access code and locking/unlocking 
code from the user. The locking/unlocking code is made using the access code with access 
code ending with 1 as unlocking and access code ending with 4 as the locking code. If 
the code entered is invalid, the program won't run. 

### Part 2
This part of the code shows the minimum, maximum and average number of tries an intruder 
would take to break the lock, this is done using a randomized program from which import 
random is excecuted. 

### Testing
This program has been tested on jupyter and has worked. The first part is user in put, 
you can put any 5 digit access code and then for the locking/unlokcing, type the access 
code followed by 4 or 1 depending on wether you want to lock or unlock.
